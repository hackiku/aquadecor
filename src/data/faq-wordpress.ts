		question: "How do I place an order?",
		answer: `If you want to order a 3D background, visit our <a href="https://wordpress.aquadecorbackgrounds.com/price-calculator1/">Price Calculator page</a>, enter the internal measurements of your tank, choose your favorite model and send a request. We will get back to you with payment details.\n\nIf you want to purchase additional items (logs, rocks, etc…), you can buy them <a href="https://wordpress.aquadecorbackgrounds.com/shop-additional-items/">directly on the website</a>.`
	},
	{
		question: "What payment options do I have?",
		answer: "At the moment, we only take PayPal. Alternatively, we can do a wire transfer, in which case we will ask you to send us your billing information needed for a proforma invoice."
	},
	{
		question: "I have a discount code, can I use it?",
		answer: "Make sure to enter the discount code before you place your order. If you are ordering a 3D background, make sure to send us the discount code in advance.\n\nWe don’t accept discount codes after the payment has been made and the production of your order has started."
	},
	{
		question: "What are backgrounds made of?",
		answer: "We have developed a special, extremely durable and natural-looking material,\nsuitable for all environments. All backgrounds are covered with protective layers\nand are completely neutral in water."
	},
	{
		question: "I have an overflow box (weir), can I still order a background?",
		answer: "Since all backgrounds are custom made, any model can be made to cover the overflow\nbox (weir). It is suggested to make the background lower around the filter, where the\ngrid is.\nWe will need you to measure the size of the filter, as well as its position in the tank."
	},
	{
		question: "I have an external filter, how can this work?",
		answer: "With standard models (A, A Slim, B, F or C models), we make chambers for inlets and heaters.\nWhen it comes to slim (E and G models), all equipment can be placed behind the\nbackground.\nThe number of chambers doesn’t affect the price, you can choose as many chambers\nas you need."
	},
	{
		question: "I have a HOB filter, how can this work?",
		answer: "With HOB filters, only slim models (E and G models) can work. Backgrounds are\nplaced in front of the filter. If you decide to order a model that needs to be\nsilicone, you will need to move the filter to the side."
	},
	{
		question: "Can I mount a background myself? What do I need for that?",
		answer: "All Aquadecor backgrounds are easy to install. For some models, you will need silicone\nfor aquariums. Slim models don’t need to be siliconed, but can (that is optional).\nYou will receive detailed instructions on how to install your background. Make sure to\nvisit our “Videos” page where we showed how to install both slim and standard\nbackgrounds."
	},
	{
		question: "How massive are your backgrounds? Do they take up a lot of space?",
		answer: "This depends on the model. We always make sure to create the best 3D effect\nwithout taking up too much space. A and C models are around 16-17 cm wide in\nthe widest parts, and 2 cm wide in the thinnest parts. A Slim models are 8 cm wide in the widest parts. B models are more\nmassive, around 20 cm in the widest parts. E and G models are slim models,\naround 7-9 cm wide in the thickest parts. Some G models are more massive than others."
	},
	{
		question: "If I order a background, will I get exactly what I see on the website?",
		answer: "All backgrounds are custom made, handmade and unique. We cannot make two\nidentical backgrounds, but what you order will be very similar to what you see on the\nwebsite."
	},
	{
		question: "What does your warranty mean?",
		answer: "Some models have a lifetime warranty, while other have a 20 year warranty. This\nmeans that, if during that period something happens, we will send you a\nreplacement background, in the same color, model and size. In order to accept\nyour claim, we will need to receive a few photos that clearly show the damage,\nand your proof of payment (bill from PayPal). We don’t accept claims in case you\nmishandles the background, modified it in any way (coated with anything, used\nanother paint to modify the color, etc…)."
	},
	{
		question: "What if my background arrives damaged?",
		answer: "Although uncommon, it can happen that a background gets damaged during transport.\nIf you receive a damaged background, make sure to send us photos of the damaged\nimmediately. If it is a minor damage, we will instruct you how to fix it. If it is a major\ndamage that cannot be easily fixed, we will send you a replacement background."
	},
	{
		question: "How long does it take to get a background?",
		answer: "The length of production depends on the size of your order, but it is usually around 10-12 business days. Delivery depends on your location, make sure to read our shipping policy before you order.\nDuring a busy holiday season, delivery can take more than expected, so if you\nplan to order during a major holiday such as Christmas or Easter, make sure to\ntake this into account."
	},
	{
		question: "When you ship my background, will I receive a tracking number?",
		answer: "Most packages are tracked, and you can ask for a tracking number. If you have a\ntracking number and there are no updates for some time, it is perfectly normal\nand that is not a reason for concern. We ship to almost all countries in the world,\nand delivery takes some time. Packages are scanned at certain checkpoints, and\ntracking info is not updated on a daily basis. During a holiday season, delivery\ncan take more than expected and we appreciate your patience in these\nsituations."
	},
	{
		question: "Can I order additional items (rocks, logs) without ordering a background.",
		answer: "You can order additional items without ordering a background. All additional items are\nsold in sets, and they are listed under D models.\nEven though the rocks are shown in one color, we can make them in the color scheme\nof your choice."
	},
	{
		question: "How much is the shipping?",
		answer: "The cost of shipping depends on the size of the background and your location. All prices\nshown in the price calculator already include the cost of shipping."
	},
	{
		question: "I have a Juwel aquarium with its original filter. How can I order a background?",
		answer: "All background models can be made for any Juwel aquarium with its original filter. There\nis no need to measure it, we already have all measurements.\nWe only need the exact model name of the aquarium, and, of course, background\nmodel you would like."
	},
	{
		question: "How can I clean my 3D background?",
		answer: "Any Aquadecor background can be cleaned with a toothbrush or a regular brush\n(such as the ones used on nails in nail salons). Do not use a knife, scalpel or a\nbrush with metal bristles, and similar sharp objects."
	},
	{
		question: "Which silicone should I use to install the background?",
		answer: "Only silicone for aquariums should be used. There are different brands in different\ncountries, and we cannot suggest a certain brand, but if it can be used to glue aquarium\nglass, you can safely use it to glue the background. If installed properly, the background\nwill stay in place for years."
	},
	{
		question: "Do I have to empty my aquarium in order to install a background?",
		answer: "This depends on the model. If you ordered a slim background (E or G models), you\ndon’t need to empty the aquarium in order to install the background. If you ordered a\nstandard background (A, B, C or K models) that needs to be siliconed, you will have to\nempty the aquarium."
