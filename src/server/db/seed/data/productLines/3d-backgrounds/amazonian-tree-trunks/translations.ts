These backgrounds come in several pieces, making installation straightforward and accommodating top supports or other obstructions within the tank. This modular approach ensures a seamless fit without compromising the functionality of your aquarium. To secure the \"B\" Models in place, they need to be siliconed to the aquarium. This ensures a stable and permanent installation, preventing any movement or shifting over time. The use of silicone also helps create a watertight seal, enhancing the overall durability and effectiveness of the background. A notable feature of the \"B\" Models is the built-in chambers at the back, which provide optional filtration support. These chambers can be used to house filtration equipment, helping to keep the interior of your tank looking clean and uncluttered. Additionally, the chambers can be configured to cover internal filters, integrating them seamlessly into the background design. The \"B\" Models are available in widths ranging from 1 to 20 cm, allowing for customization based on your specific tank dimensions and needs. This flexibility ensures that you can achieve the desired look and functionality for your aquarium setup. Explore our range of \"B\" Models to find the perfect background that combines ease of installation, effective filtration options, and a visually appealing design. Enhance your aquarium environment with Aquadecor’s \"B\" Models and enjoy a beautiful and functional aquatic display.",
