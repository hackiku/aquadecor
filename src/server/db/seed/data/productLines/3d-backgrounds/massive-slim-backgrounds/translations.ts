These backgrounds are crafted to adapt to various tank configurations, making them suitable for aquariums with top supports or other structural elements. If needed, we can create these backgrounds in several pieces to ensure a perfect fit, eliminating any installation challenges. The \"N\" Models do not require siliconing for installation, which means they can be easily placed in a fully stocked aquarium without the need for additional adhesives. This feature simplifies the installation process and allows for quick adjustments if necessary. The backgrounds are designed to remain securely in place without shifting or detaching, providing a stable and reliable enhancement to your tank. One of the standout features of the \"N\" Models is the hollow space at the back. This innovative design allows for convenient placement of all your essential equipment, such as filters and heaters, behind the background. This not only helps to keep your tank’s interior looking neat and organized but also provides easy access for maintenance and adjustments. With a width range of 1 to 20 cm, the \"N\" Models offer versatility to fit various tank sizes and configurations.
