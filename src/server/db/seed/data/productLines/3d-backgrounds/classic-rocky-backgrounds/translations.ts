These backgrounds are engineered to come in a few pieces, making installation easy and adaptable to various tank configurations. Whether your aquarium has top supports or other structural elements, the modular design ensures a smooth and hassle-free assembly process. For a secure and permanent fit, the \"A\" Models need to be siliconed to the aquarium. This method ensures that the background stays firmly in place, preventing any movement or shifting over time. The silicone application also creates a watertight seal, enhancing the durability and longevity of the background while maintaining a seamless appearance. A notable feature of the \"A\" Models is the inclusion of chambers at the back. These chambers offer optional filtration support, allowing you to integrate filtration equipment discreetly within the background. This feature helps to keep the interior of your tank clean and organized, while also improving the efficiency of your filtration system. Additionally, the design can cover internal filters, seamlessly blending them into the background and preserving the visual appeal of your aquarium. The \"A\" Models come in widths ranging from 1 to 17 cm, providing flexibility to accommodate different tank sizes and configurations. This range allows you to select the perfect fit for your specific setup, ensuring both aesthetic harmony and functional efficiency. Enhance your aquarium with the versatile and stylish \"A\" Models from Aquadecor.

These backgrounds are engineered to come in a few pieces, making installation easy and adaptable to various tank configurations. Whether your aquarium has top supports or other structural elements, the modular design ensures a smooth and hassle-free assembly process. For a secure and permanent fit, the \"A\" Models need to be siliconed to the aquarium. This method ensures that the background stays firmly in place, preventing any movement or shifting over time. The silicone application also creates a watertight seal, enhancing the durability and longevity of the background while maintaining a seamless appearance. A notable feature of the \"A\" Models is the inclusion of chambers at the back. These chambers offer optional filtration support, allowing you to integrate filtration equipment discreetly within the background. This feature helps to keep the interior of your tank clean and organized, while also improving the efficiency of your filtration system. Additionally, the design can cover internal filters, seamlessly blending them into the background and preserving the visual appeal of your aquarium. The \"A\" Models come in widths ranging from 1 to 17 cm, providing flexibility to accommodate different tank sizes and configurations. This range allows you to select the perfect fit for your specific setup, ensuring both aesthetic harmony and functional efficiency. Enhance your aquarium with the versatile and stylish \"A\" Models from Aquadecor.
