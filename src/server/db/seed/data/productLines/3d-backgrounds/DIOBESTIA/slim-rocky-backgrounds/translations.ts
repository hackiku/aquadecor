			"fullDescription": "The \"A Slim\" Models are specifically designed and offering a sleek and functional solution to enhance your aquarium setup. With a maximum width of just 8 cm (3.2″), these backgrounds are ideal for tanks with limited space, allowing you to add a touch of natural beauty without overwhelming the tank’s dimensions. The \"A Slim\" Models are engineered to come in several pieces, making installation straightforward and accommodating various tank configurations, including those with top supports or other structural elements. This modular design ensures a smooth assembly process, allowing for easy integration into your aquarium setup. To ensure a secure and permanent fit, the \"A Slim\" Models need to be siliconed to the aquarium. This method provides a stable installation, preventing any movement or detachment over time. The silicone also creates a watertight seal, contributing to the durability and seamless integration of the background. Each \"A Slim\" Model comes with a built-in chamber for filtration, which can be positioned in either the left or right corner, or both, depending on your needs. The chamber size is 5 x 4 cm (2″ x 1.6″), providing ample space to house filtration equipment discreetly. This feature helps to maintain a clean and organized tank while optimizing the functionality of your filtration system. Transform your narrow tank with the elegant and practical \"A Slim\" Models from Aquadecor. Enjoy easy installation, effective filtration integration, and a beautifully designed background that enhances the functionality and aesthetics of your aquarium.",
