These innovative rocks offer unparalleled versatility, allowing you to arrange them however you like to customize your aquarium environment. Whether you prefer to attach them to the back of the tank, the sides, or even use them to cleverly conceal equipment, the magnetic rocks adapt to your design vision with ease. Each rock is designed with a maximum width of approximately 15 cm (6″) from front to back, making them suitable for a variety of tank sizes and configurations. Their magnetic properties ensure they adhere securely to your tank’s surfaces, providing a stable setup that can be adjusted or repositioned as needed. For an enhanced visual effect, we recommend using black or blue foil on the back of the tank. This backdrop will create a striking contrast with the magnetic rocks, emphasizing their natural beauty and making them stand out even more in your aquarium. Our magnetic rocks are available in different sets to accommodate various tank sizes. The smaller set is ideal for tanks approximately 48″ long and 21″ tall (122 cm x 53 cm) or similar dimensions, while the larger set is designed for tanks around 71″ long and 24″ tall (185 cm x 61 cm) or similar.
