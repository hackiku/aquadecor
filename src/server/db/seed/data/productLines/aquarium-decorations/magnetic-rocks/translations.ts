			"shortDescription": "Classic neutral gray magnetic rocks with clean, minimalist design. Instantly attach to any glass surface using powerful built-in magnets or included vacuum suction cups.",
			"fullDescription": "Our bestselling Gray Stone Magnetic Rocks are the original revolutionary modular decoration that changed aquarium design forever.\n\n\nEach handcrafted module features ultra-strong embedded neodymium magnets capable of holding securely through glass up to 19 mm (¾\") thick. For tanks with thicker glass or temporary installations, we include premium silicone vacuum suction cups as a secondary mounting option — giving you total flexibility.\n\n\nWith a maximum projection of just 15 cm (6\") from the glass, these rocks create dramatic 3D depth without sacrificing valuable swimming space. Use them to build floating cliff formations, hide unsightly equipment behind natural-looking stone, or create territorial zones for shy or breeding fish.\n\n\nAvailable in two perfectly curated sets:\n\n• Small Set – Ideal for tanks 120–150 cm (48\"–60\") long and up to 53 cm (21\") tall\n\n• Large Set – Designed for panoramic tanks 180–240 cm (71\"–94\") long and 60–70 cm (24\"–28\") tall\n\n\nFor maximum visual impact, we strongly recommend installing against a black or deep blue background foil. The dark backdrop creates stunning contrast that makes the gray stone texture pop and gives the illusion of infinite depth — a trick used by professional aquascapers worldwide.\n\n\nCompletely safe for all freshwater and marine species. Zero tannins, zero pH swing, zero maintenance. Reposition in seconds. Clean with a magic eraser. Built to last a lifetime.\n\n\nJoin thousands of aquarists who’ve ditched traditional glued rockwork for the freedom and creativity of magnetic aquascaping.",
