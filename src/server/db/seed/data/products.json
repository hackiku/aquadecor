The design imitates a rocky riverbed with stones in a singular tone. The entire aquarium is divided into three planes – an aquarium cover, floor, and a middle zone, with elements standing at various heights to create a dramatic natural impression of depth. The space between the grains and the background allows for hiding aquarium equipment such as filters, aerators, and oxygen stones. The narrow passageways allow your fish to inhabit and swim in the spaces created, giving them numerous hiding spots of various sizes. Available in a wide range of sizes."
