			fullDescription: "Our Medium Flex Backgrounds are a fantastic option for aquarium enthusiasts looking for a flexible, easy-to-install solution that offers both beauty and functionality. These backgrounds come in 2-3 parts and are designed with flexibility in mind, allowing them to fit comfortably in various tank sizes. Unlike other backgrounds, there is no need to use silicone or adhesives to attach them to the tank, simplifying the installation process. The seams between the parts are carefully designed to follow the natural lines of the rocks, making them almost invisible once installed, ensuring a seamless, natural look. Another advantage is that these backgrounds can be placed in aquariums that are already filled with water, so you don’t need to drain your tank to upgrade your aquarium's appearance. With a 10-year warranty and a production time of 10-12 business days, Medium Flex Backgrounds are built to last and look stunning. For those seeking an even more premium option, our Ultra Flex Backgrounds offer unparalleled flexibility and ease of use. As part of our new premium line of 3D backgrounds, Ultra Flex Backgrounds come in a single part, eliminating the need for assembly. They feature magnets on the back, which make installation incredibly simple and quick. The magnets are coated with a protective film to ensure that your tank glass remains scratch-free. These backgrounds can also be installed in fully filled aquariums, allowing you to enhance your tank’s visual appeal without disrupting the environment. With a lifetime warranty and a production time of 10-12 business days, Ultra Flex Backgrounds are the perfect blend of convenience and premium quality for any aquarium.",
