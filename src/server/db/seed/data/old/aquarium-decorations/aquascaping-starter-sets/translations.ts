			fullDescription: "This comprehensive set consists of 4 standing logs, one “fallen” log, and one hollow log with tree bark, perfect for creating a captivating Amazonian-themed aquarium or a similar natural setup. The standing logs are each 70 cm tall, providing significant vertical elements that add depth and interest to your tank's landscape. The hollow log with tree bark measures approximately 80 cm in length, offering an excellent hiding spot for fish species that appreciate secluded areas, enhancing their sense of security and well-being. Discus fish, in particular, are known to love standing logs, as they mimic the natural tree trunks found in their native habitats. The inclusion of the “fallen” log adds a horizontal dimension to the setup, creating a more dynamic and realistic underwater environment. The hollow log not only serves as a hideaway but also encourages natural behaviors, promoting a healthier and more active aquatic community. We understand that tank sizes and design preferences vary, so if you would like the logs to be shorter than 70 cm, please leave us a note when placing your order. We are happy to customize the height of the logs to suit your specific needs, ensuring a perfect fit for your aquarium. Installation is flexible to accommodate your setup preferences. The standing logs can be siliconed to the bottom of the tank for a permanent fixture, providing stability and preventing movement caused by active fish or water currents. Alternatively, you can attach them to small glass or ceramic plates, allowing you to place them in the tank without permanent adhesion. This method offers the convenience of repositioning or removing the logs as needed. One of the significant advantages of these logs is that they don't need to be soaked before use, saving you time during the setup process. They are crafted from durable materials designed for aquatic environments and can be reused an unlimited number of times. This longevity makes them a practical and cost-effective addition to your aquarium, providing lasting beauty and functionality. Enhance your aquarium with this versatile set, creating a natural and engaging habitat that not only looks stunning but also supports the health and happiness of your fish. Whether you're an experienced aquarist or just starting, this set offers an easy way to elevate your tank's aesthetics and provide enrichment for your aquatic life.",
