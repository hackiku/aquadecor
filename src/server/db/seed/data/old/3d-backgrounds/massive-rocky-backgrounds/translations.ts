			fullDescription: "Our \"C\" Models are designed to offer a blend of practicality and visual appeal for your aquarium setup. These backgrounds come in multiple pieces, facilitating an easy installation process and ensuring compatibility with various tank configurations, including those with top supports or other structural elements. This modular design allows for a seamless and hassle-free assembly. To secure the \"C\" Models in place, they need to be siliconed to the aquarium. This ensures a stable and permanent fit, preventing any movement or detachment over time. The silicone application also creates a watertight seal, enhancing the durability and integration of the background with your aquarium. A distinctive feature of the \"C\" Models is the inclusion of chambers at the back. These chambers offer optional filtration support, allowing you to discreetly incorporate your filtration system within the background. This design helps maintain a clean and organized tank interior while optimizing the functionality of your filtration setup. Additionally, the background can cover internal filters, integrating them seamlessly into the overall design and preserving the visual appeal of your aquarium. The \"C\" Models are available in widths ranging from 1 to 18 cm, providing flexibility to accommodate different tank sizes and configurations. This range allows you to select the perfect fit for your specific setup, ensuring both aesthetic harmony and functional efficiency. Transform your aquarium with the versatile and stylish \"C\" Models from Aquadecor. Enjoy easy installation, effective filtration integration, and a beautifully designed background that enhances the look and functionality of your tank.",
