			fullDescription: "Our Medium Flex Backgrounds are a fantastic option for aquarium enthusiasts looking for a flexible, easy-to-install solution that offers both beauty and functionality. These backgrounds come in 2-3 parts and are designed with flexibility in mind, allowing them to fit comfortably in various tank sizes. Unlike other backgrounds, there is no need to use silicone or adhesives to attach them to the tank, simplifying the installation process. The seams between the parts are carefully designed to follow the natural lines of the rocks, making them almost invisible once installed, ensuring a seamless, natural look. Another advantage is that these backgrounds can be placed in aquariums that are already filled with water, so you don’t need to drain your tank to upgrade your aquarium's appearance.

These backgrounds come in 2-3 parts and are designed with flexibility in mind, allowing them to fit comfortably in various tank sizes. Unlike other backgrounds, there is no need to use silicone or adhesives to attach them to the tank, simplifying the installation process. The seams between the parts are carefully designed to follow the natural lines of the rocks, making them almost invisible once installed, ensuring a seamless, natural look. Another advantage is that these backgrounds can be placed in aquariums that are already filled with water, so you don’t need to drain your tank to upgrade your aquarium's appearance. With a 10-year warranty and a production time of 10-12 business days, Medium Flex Backgrounds are built to last and look stunning. For those seeking an even more premium option, our Ultra Flex Backgrounds offer unparalleled flexibility and ease of use. As part of our new premium line of 3D backgrounds, Ultra Flex Backgrounds come in a single part, eliminating the need for assembly. They feature magnets on the back, which make installation incredibly simple and quick. The magnets are coated with a protective film to ensure that your tank glass remains scratch-free. These backgrounds can also be installed in fully filled aquariums, allowing you to enhance your tank’s visual appeal without disrupting the environment. With a lifetime warranty and a production time of 10-12 business days, Ultra Flex Backgrounds are the perfect blend of convenience and premium quality for any aquarium.",

The standing logs are each 70 cm tall, providing significant vertical elements that add depth and interest to your tank's landscape. The hollow log with tree bark measures approximately 80 cm in length, offering an excellent hiding spot for fish species that appreciate secluded areas, enhancing their sense of security and well-being. Discus fish, in particular, are known to love standing logs, as they mimic the natural tree trunks found in their native habitats. The inclusion of the “fallen” log adds a horizontal dimension to the setup, creating a more dynamic and realistic underwater environment. The hollow log not only serves as a hideaway but also encourages natural behaviors, promoting a healthier and more active aquatic community. We understand that tank sizes and design preferences vary, so if you would like the logs to be shorter than 70 cm, please leave us a note when placing your order. We are happy to customize the height of the logs to suit your specific needs, ensuring a perfect fit for your aquarium. Installation is flexible to accommodate your setup preferences. The standing logs can be siliconed to the bottom of the tank for a permanent fixture, providing stability and preventing movement caused by active fish or water currents. Alternatively, you can attach them to small glass or ceramic plates, allowing you to place them in the tank without permanent adhesion. This method offers the convenience of repositioning or removing the logs as needed. One of the significant advantages of these logs is that they don't need to be soaked before use, saving you time during the setup process.

The holes can be placed to be seen by the observer’s eye as well as not to be seen, i.e. to face the rear glass. The choice is yours.
