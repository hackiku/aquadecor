			"paragraph2": "\"I would spend hours looking at the result of my work,\" Florian recalls. \"Bit by bit, the whole picture started to show up. My favorite part is the final details—the cherry on top. Painting affects the final look substantially, and you can change the appearance of a 3D background easily.\"",
