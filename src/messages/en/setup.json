		{
			"title": "Classic Single Wall Setup",
			"description": "The most popular configuration - covers the back glass with one equipment chamber. Perfect for standard aquariums against a wall. Chamber (8×8cm or 10×10cm) can be positioned in either corner for your heater and intake pipe. Water flows naturally through the gap between glass and background, protected by transparent mesh.",
			"bestFor": "Standard aquariums, beginners"
		},
		{
			"title": "Natural Crack Design",
			"description": "Elevate your setup with naturally integrated equipment hiding. Water enters through realistic cracks in the rockwork instead of visible gaps. Your heater and intake stay together in the chamber while the background maintains its organic appearance throughout.",
			"bestFor": "Advanced aquascaping"
		},
		{
			"title": "L-Shape Corner Mount",
			"description": "Maximize your aquarium's presence by covering the back wall plus one side. Ideal for tanks positioned next to walls or in corners. The single corner chamber keeps all equipment hidden while water flows through natural-looking fissures in the background.",
			"bestFor": "Corner placements, side-wall tanks"
		},
		{
			"title": "Full Surround Immersion",
			"description": "Transform your aquarium into a viewing portal. Covers back and both sides, creating a complete underwater world visible only through the front glass. Dual corner chambers handle all equipment with water entering through convincingly natural cracks.",
			"bestFor": "Room dividers, centerpiece tanks"
		},
		{
			"title": "Island Divider Setup",
			"description": "Place the background in the center as a natural divider with chambers or filters on either side. Perfect for double-sided viewing or using as a filter cover. Water flows through organic-looking openings while equipment stays completely concealed.",
			"bestFor": "Between-room installations"
		},
		{
			"title": "Depth Illusion Design",
			"description": "Create dramatic depth by partially covering a black/navy foiled back glass. The background appears to float in space while chambers hide in corners. Water enters through the gap covered by transparent mesh, maximizing the 3D effect.",
			"bestFor": "Maximizing depth perception"
		},
		{
			"title": "Multi-Wall Depth Design",
			"description": "Extend the depth illusion to one or both sides with foiled glass. Corner chambers remain hidden while water flows through natural cracks. Creates an incredibly immersive viewing experience, especially effective in wall-mounted installations.",
			"bestFor": "Wall-mounted, built-in tanks"
		},
		{
			"title": "Internal Filter Integration",
			"description": "Hide any internal filter regardless of location. Custom cracks and entrances match your specific filter type. For overflow systems, the background sits lower to allow top water flow. Your filter disappears while remaining fully functional.",
			"bestFor": "Internal filters, overflow systems"
		},
		{
			"title": "Stream Pump Cover",
			"description": "Classic back wall coverage with bonus: hide your stream pump behind a detachable rock. Full access maintained - remove, relocate, or redirect water flow anytime. Equipment chamber handles heater and intake as usual.",
			"bestFor": "High-flow systems, wave makers"
		},
		{
			"title": "Slim Bio-Filter Design",
			"description": "Flexible one-piece background with biological filtration space behind it. Fill the gap with bio-balls, sponge, or Siporax. Drill custom holes for water flow (DIY or we'll do it), add a powerhead in the corner, and you've got a hidden bio-filter that looks like solid rock.",
			"bestFor": "Biological filtration, cichlid tanks"
