Hello, my name is Florian Kovac. Welcome to the DecorGroup that consists of two companies: AquaDecor and TerraDecor. Please take a look at what we do. As the first and only company that makes custom-made aquarium interiors, we at AquaDecor still produce over 70 models of aquarium backgrounds, even after 15 years of being in business.

Apart from that, we also make additional segments and decoration that look exactly like stone, then branches and tree stumps, which perfectly match every background or aquarium that you have or plan to order. Every piece we make is unique. We are inspired only by those things that can be found in nature and in the natural habitats of fish species that customers have chosen to keep.

For this reason, the slogan of AquaDecor is "only nature can copy us."

If you keep fish from the Malawi or Tanganyika Lakes, the stone we make will be identical to the one found in those lakes. If you keep a type of fish that belongs to one of the numerous species from the river Amazon, we can make an interior that suits their habitat, and that is usually something with a lot of roots and other wooden elements. We do this solely to make the types of fish you keep feel as if they were really in their natural habitats.

Members of our staff work daily to produce new models, to perfect them, taking into account the tiniest of details such as shapes, colors, and natural occurrences, such as algae, cracks, etc. Apart from their visual effect, we also tend to make them exceptionally durable and long-lasting.

We would like to note that we are the only company in the world that does custom models of backgrounds for our clients that have custom aquariums or special wishes in terms of specific dimensions, and also specific requests for additional chambers that serve as covers for visually unappealing aquarium equipment. For this reason, we make a special design for each customer before we begin the production itself, and consulting with our staff on premises is often required prior to production.

After backgrounds are finished and painted, each one of them undergoes a special disinfection procedure, after which it is sent for inspection in terms of dimensions, quality, and other details concerning that particular background. After a detailed quality control, each background is carefully packaged and dispatched in our vehicles to our distribution center, from where the packages are further redistributed to our customers.

All AquaDecor products and the entire production process are patented, and our name is a registered trademark in the territories of the European Union, the USA, and many other countries. For this reason, soon after founding AquaDecor in 2004, a company called TerraDecor was founded, which is, like AquaDecor, a part of a group called DecorGroup, and is dedicated solely to interior decoration.

The natural look of each aquarium was always missing the part of nature which we create in order to make it look perfect. Order your authentic background today. www.aquadecorbackgrounds.com
